# WikiQuiz - AI Study Tool

> WikiQuiz is a Chrome extension that generates custom quizzes directly from any Wikipedia article. Choose a whole article or a specific section and instantly get targeted questions to help you learn faster and retain more.


## 🌟 Why Wikiquiz

Studying from Wikipedia often means switching tabs, copying text, or relying on AI summaries. WikiQuiz removes this inconvenience by letting you create relevant quizzes directly on the page you're reading.

- Generate fast, content-specific quizzes from any Wikipedia section
- Target specific topics to learn rather than broad and surface-level questions
- Powered by GPT-4o mini for speed and GPT-4.1 for longer, more complex questions
- No more context switching or copy-pasting. Wikiquiz allows you to quiz yourself directly on Wikipedia
- Detailed feedback on every question
- Customizable difficulties and question numbers
